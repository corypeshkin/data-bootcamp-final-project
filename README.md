#### Project Description
The Hang Seng China AH Premium Index (“AH Premium”) represents the ratio, at a given time, of the premium the market has priced into Chinese “A+H shares”. A+H shares represent companies with which have floated shares simultaneously in Hong Kong (H shares denominated in Hong Kong Dollar) and in mainland China (A shares denominated in Chinese yuan renminbi; listed on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen Stock Exchanges). The AH Premium is calculated with market capitalization-weighting and free-float adjusted shares outstanding.


The AH Premium is generally quoted above 100 (i.e. A shares trade above H shares when quoted in the US Dollar) since Chinese capital controls both prevent mainland investment in Hong Kong as well as foreign investment into mainland China’s equity markets. That said, there are other drivers into this premium that this project aims to investigate. Notably, the implementation of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (“SHKSC”) investment channel in November 17, 2014 saw a marked increase in the premium, of which has largely remained.
